# Date-Practice
This is a personal project to help me practice using dates. This is a simple web app that does the following: 
* Shows user an input for a new date/time.
* The user can input a date/time and press submit.
* This is sent to an array and then saved to local storage.
* The local storage is retrieved and parsed to produce a dates array.
* This array is printed below the date input and formatted nicely.

  The purpose of this project is to practice using time stamps to get accurate dates from user input, that are stored and then retrieved and displayed. I had issues with a previous project that used dates and I kept getting errors because the date format kept changing based on time zones.
